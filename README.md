# Python graph library

A custom graph library, made to aid studying Algorithm and Data Structures, complete with some common algoritms implementations.

It intentionally doesn't use OOP principles, to make the code similar to the pseudocode used in the exams.

If you need a more complete (and better written) graph library, look into [python-igraph](https://igraph.org/python) and the other GitHub projects about graphs.
